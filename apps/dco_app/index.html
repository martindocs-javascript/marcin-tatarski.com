              <h2>The Design</h2>
              <p>
                This is a web app which was created for keeping track of
                products' development changes. I used a
                <span
                  class="tooltip"
                  title="This is a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. MERN stand for (M)ongoDB (E)xpress (R)eact (N)ode. "
                  >MERN</span
                >
                stack, with a bit of Vanilla Javascript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the UI elements were created from scratch. The logo was
                designed in Inkscape, and for the icons I used
                <a href="https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/"
                  >React Icons</a
                >.
              </p>

              <h2>Login Screen and Main Page</h2>
              <p>
                The app is only accessible for people within the company. There
                are four different account types;
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>User - for people who are approving documents</li>
                <li>Editor - creators of the documents</li>
                <li>
                  Guest - for anyone within the company who wants access, just
                  to search the database
                </li>
                <li>Admin - can access all parts of the website</li>
              </ul>
              <img
                class="img-zoom-in"
                src="./img/joerns_dco-login-screen.png"
                alt="login screen"
              />
              <p>
                The "All Dco's" page is available for every account. The
                edit/delete features are only available/visible for the admin.
              </p>
              <p>The main features include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All users have access to the help page and can logout from the
                  app <span class="circle">1</span>. The settings include a
                  dark/light theme mode. Additionaly, the admin account has
                  access to the dashboard page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Search form <span class="circle">3</span>, has an option
                  to filter documents by their status (pending, approved,
                  rejected), using alphabetical order (a-z or z-a) or by their
                  date (newest / oldest). In the field box
                  <span class="circle">2</span>, the user can search for
                  documents by their Title.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Comments section is hidden by default, and can be accessed
                  by clicking on the speech bubble
                  <span class="circle">4</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Changes section includes a link to a pdf form
                  <span class="circle">5</span>. The pdf form will pop up on a
                  new tab.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Text <span class="circle">6</span> under the Title will
                  change its status if all users have approved it or if the
                  document is rejected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Status bar <span class="circle">7</span> indicates who has
                  already approved the document (green) and who rejected it
                  (red). Hovering over any of the squares will show the name of
                  the approver. Additionally, if any of the users reject the
                  document, it won't be available for others in their Inbox,
                  until the creator of the document updates it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <img
                class="img-zoom-in"

                alt="admin main page"
              />
              <p>
                Depending on the account type, some features won't be
                accessible/visible.
              </p>
              <img
                class="img-zoom-in"

                alt="user / admin main page"
              />

              <p>
                Search results are paginated <span class="circle">8</span>, with
                six results per page.
              </p>
              <img
                class="img-zoom-in"

                alt="pagination"
              />

              <h2>Add Dco Page</h2>
              <p>This is only available for the admin and editor accounts.</p>
              <p>The main features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A DCO number <span class="circle">1</span> will be generated
                  each time an editor/admin creates a new document.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Part list section <span class="circle">2</span> has a
                  button to add additional field boxes if needed. To remove an
                  unwanted field, the user needs to hover over the left side of
                  the field and press the minus symbol.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When adding a file, the user will get a small preview
                  <span class="circle">3</span>. Depending on the browser, the
                  user may get some additional functionality (zoom in/out etc).
                  Adding files is restricted to only one pdf.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <img
                class="img-zoom-in"
                src="./img/joerns_dco-add-dco.png"
                alt="add dco page"
              />

              <h2>Edit Dco Page</h2>
              <p>
                Edit functionality is only available for the editors of the
                documents and it's accessible through the Inbox page.
              </p>
              <img
                class="img-zoom-in"
                src="./img/joerns_dco-edit-dco.png"
                alt="edit dco page"
              />

              <h2>Inbox Page</h2>
              <p>
                This is mostly for the users and editors. Depending on the
                account type, some features will have different appearances.
              </p>
              <p>The main features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When a document is submitted <span class="circle">1</span>, it
                  will disappear from that user's Inbox. The editors of that
                  document will still have access to it, until all users have
                  approved it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The approvers can add comments
                  <span class="circle">2</span> to the document before
                  submitting it. The comments are optional when approving it and
                  are only required if the users reject it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the document is rejected, it won't be available/visible to
                  others users. The editor needs to update it first. After
                  updating the document, the status bar will be reset to default
                  (grey squres) <span class="circle">3</span>. The only part
                  which is not reset is the comments section
                  <span class="circle">4</span>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <img
                class="img-zoom-in"
                src="./img/joerns_dco-inbox-screen-user.png"
                alt="user inbox page"
              />
              <p>
                The Inbox page for the editors of the documents looks very
                simillar to the Inbox page for approvers. The only changes are
                the edit/delete buttons <span class="circle">1</span>.
              </p>
              <img
                class="img-zoom-in"
                src="./img/joerns_dco-inbox-screen-editor.png"
                alt="editor inbox page"
              />

              <h2>Favourites Page</h2>
              <p>Includes the favourite documents of each user.</p>

              <h2>Mobile/Tablets</h2>
              <p>It has a few basic features.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Hamburger menu <span class="circle">1</span>, with a modal
                  version of the side menu <span class="circle">2</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Depending on the screen size and the display results
                  <span class="circle">3</span>, the amount of columns can vary.
                  There are three columns on desktop, two columns on tablets and
                  one column on mobile.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <img
