                        <h2>The Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is a web app which was created for keeping track of products' development changes. I used a <span class="tooltip" title="This is a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. MERN stand for (M)ongoDB (E)xpress (R)eact (N)ode. ">MERN</span> stack, with a bit of Vanilla Javascript.
                        </p>                                                   
                        <p>
                            Most of the UI elements were created from scratch. The logo was designed in Inkscape, and for the icons I used <a href="https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/">React Icons</a>. 
                        </p>

                            The app is only accessible for people within the company. There are four different account types;
